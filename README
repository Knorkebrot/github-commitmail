github commitmail
=================

This little Perl script gives you the missing feature of a commit mail on
github. Well, at least I was missing it ;)


CPAN dependencies
-----------------

JSON
Mail::Send
LWP::UserAgent


installation
-----------------

To install please use a bsd'ish make. you may need to install it on a linux
machine. FreeBSD just 'make', OSX 'bsdmake' and on my Debian box I needed to
install the package 'freebsd-buildutils' to get 'freebsd-make'.
You will need to have PREFIX set, whitch is the part in front of '/bin' and
'/etc'.

targets:
	install
	uninstall


configuration
-----------------

See $PREFIX/etc/github-commitmail.conf.sample for examples


usage
-----------------

Write a crontab entry for the script ;)
Write something into your config file and start the script without any
arguments.
