When I created this project I just started using git. I was a Subversion
guy.

Well, the point is: this code tried to solve a problem I wouldn't have had if
I just had been using git the right way. Also the attempt failes if someone
rewrites their history. (Which is still a sin to me. Yes, I'm looking at you,
mootools devs!)

(The code is archived in the "old" branch.)
